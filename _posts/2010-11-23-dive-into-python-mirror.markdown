Recently, DiveIntoPython.org was taken down. It is was a site/book
written by Mark Pilgrim to help you learn Python. It is how I taught
myself Python, and still a very valuable resource that I go back to time
and time again. Unfortunately, Mark has taken down all of his sites on
the Internet, with no notice/explanation.  Luckily, he has provided all
of his sites under open licenses, allowing and encouraging people to
mirror them. I bought [DiveIntoPython.net](http://diveIntoPython), and
found an old copy of his site, and put it up. Unfortunately, it is not
complete: it is still missing some of the downloads and all of the
translations. If you have copies of the files or the translations,
please leave a comment or [email me](mailto:josh@servercobra.com).

Likewise, I have also mirrored DiveIntoPython3 at
[DiveIntoPython3.net](http://DiveIntoPython3.net) and DiveIntoHTML5 at
[DiveIntoHTML5.net](http://DiveIntoHTML5.net).
